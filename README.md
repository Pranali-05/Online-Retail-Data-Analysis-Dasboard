Sharing my First Virtual Internship Experience with Tata Hi Everyone, In today’s world, Virtual internships are important because they provide accessibility, flexibility, and the opportunity to develop remote work skills. They enable global networking, reduce costs, and help individuals gain valuable remote collaboration experience.

In this task, There will be a set of 5 questions on different situations where you need to find the most suitable graph for the situation. Overall, this task helps you to gain knowledge on selecting the visuals for different scenarios.

# Question 1:
The CEO of the retail store is interested in viewing the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view granular data by looking into monthly revenue. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the following year.

# Question 3
The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue-generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue-generating customers. The CMO wants to target higher revenue-generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.

# Question 4:
You would need to create a map chart here as the map chart would allow the CEO to view the entire map of the world and it will highlight each country and show the total number of units sold or the name of the country. You would need to filter out the United Kingdom from the data as it is not needed in this visual. Make sure that the name of the country or the total units sold is visible for each country. Guidance on how to create the map chart is provided in the resources section.
